Various rendering experiments for X4 Foundation.

NOTE! This mod is still very much WIP!!

How to install:
Download by clicking the green "Code" button and select the "Download Zip" button.
Go to your root X4 Foundation install folder. In Steam you can right click the game icon and under "Manage" you can select "Browse local files" to find the root install folder, and in that you find "extensions" 
Open the ZIP file. In it you find the autogenerated "X4FoundationShaderMod" folder, drag that folder into the "extensions" folder.
Once in game in the main menu go to Extension and make sure "Shader Improvements" is on, and then you are good to go!
